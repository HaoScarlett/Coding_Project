Welcome to my coding playground, where pixels meet passion, and bugs fear to tread. This README is your backstage pass to the chaotic symphony of my learning journey in Front-end web development.

**Overview:**
Expect HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, etc. Games, tools, and a dash of whimsy await. It's where I flex my coding muscles and occasionally pull a virtual hamstring.

**Challenges:**
Expect frustration, confusion. Debugging is my cardio, and I'm lifting bugs like they're going out of style.

**What's Inside:**
1. **Games** 
2. **Useful Tools** 
3. **Something Fun** 

**Frustration Level Indicator:**
- Mild Frustration: 🐡
- Moderate Frustration: 🦭
- Maximum Frustration: 🐉 

Happy coding 🧑🏼‍🎤
